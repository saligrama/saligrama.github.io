* Joint w/ Andrew Shen. Advised by [Jon Gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com) and [M. Frans Kaashoek](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/frans-kaashoek).

**Adversarial machine learning** (*MIT Madry Lab, Jan 2019 -- Jun 2020*)
* Explored effectiveness of ensembling with robust and non-robust features for robustness under adversarial attack.
* Developed ensemble schemes that yield same adversarial robustness as a single model but improve natural accuracy.
* Paper published in ICLR 2020 workshop on trustworthy machine learning (44% acceptance rate).
* Advised by [Aleksandr Madry](https://madry.mit.edu/).

**Virtual assistants for customer support queries** (*Stanford OVAL, Apr 2021 -- Dec 2021*)
* Created virtual assistant pipeline to classify customer support requests with GPT-3 data augmentation; increased sample data size by 4x.
* Advised by [Monica Lam](https://suif.stanford.edu/~lam/).
